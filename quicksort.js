// Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning it can sort items of any type 
// where a 'less than' relation is defined.

// Time Complexity: 
// Best case: O(n log n) 
// Average:  O(n log n) 
// Worst case: O(n2) - this is rare.

// Basic Idea: 
// 1. Pick one element in the array, which will be the pivot.
// 2. Make one pass through the array, re-arranging the entries so:
  // the pivot is in its proper place.
  // entries smaller than the pivot are to the left of the pivot.
  // entries larger than the pivot are to its right.
// 3. Recursively apply quicksort to the part of the array left of the pivot, 
// and to the right part of the array.

// To Do: Write a function that takes an array of integers and uses quick sort to return a sorted array.


function quickSort (array){
  
}
